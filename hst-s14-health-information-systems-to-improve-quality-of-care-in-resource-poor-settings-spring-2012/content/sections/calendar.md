The OCW calendar combines material from the Spring 2011 offering (course number HST.184) and Spring 2012 offering (course number HST.S14), sequenced in a way the instructors feel makes sense for OCW users. The 2011 class emphasized lectures by guest speakers, whereas the 2012 class focused on case studies and mentored projects.
